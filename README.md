# SUVAT Dynamics Calculator

This program calculates the unknown data from the 4 basic formulas of dynamics (SUVAT) if you know the values of any 3 of these, you can find the other 2 easily. The program is designed to take inputs in the MKS (Meter, Kilogram, Second) units and provide output in the same.

## Information

The program defines unknown data using the 4 basic formulas of dynamics, commonly referred to as 'SUVAT':
- **s**: Distance traveled
- **u**: Initial velocity
- **v**: Final velocity
- **a**: Acceleration
- **t**: Time of travel

## Instructions

1. **Input all data in MKS units (Meter, Kilogram, Second).**
2. **The program will provide output in MKS units.**

## Usage

### Find Distance Traveled (s)

1. Press `s` to find the distance traveled.
2. Enter the data you have:
   - `1`: Starting velocity, acceleration, and time of travel
   - `2`: Starting velocity, ending velocity, and acceleration
   - `3`: Starting velocity, ending velocity, and time

### Find Initial Velocity (u)

1. Press `u` to find the starting velocity.
2. Enter the data you have:
   - `1`: Distance, acceleration, and time of travel
   - `2`: Distance, ending velocity, and time of travel
   - `3`: Distance, acceleration, and ending velocity
   - `4`: Ending velocity, acceleration, and time of travel

### Find Final Velocity (v)

1. Press `v` to find the ending velocity.
2. Enter the data you have:
   - `1`: Distance, starting velocity, and time of travel
   - `2`: Distance, starting velocity, and acceleration
   - `3`: Starting velocity, acceleration, and time of travel

### Find Acceleration (a)

1. Press `a` to find the acceleration.
2. Enter the data you have:
   - `1`: Distance, starting velocity, and time of travel
   - `2`: Distance, starting velocity, and ending velocity
   - `3`: Starting velocity, ending velocity, and time of travel

### Find Time of Travel (t)

1. Press `t` to find the time of travel.
2. Enter the data you have:
   - `1`: Distance, starting velocity, and acceleration
   - `2`: Distance, starting velocity, and ending velocity
   - `3`: Starting velocity, ending velocity, and acceleration

## Example

To find the distance traveled given the starting velocity, acceleration, and time of travel:
1. Press `s`.
2. Press `1` to select starting velocity, acceleration, and time of travel.
3. Enter the starting velocity, acceleration, and time of travel when prompted.
